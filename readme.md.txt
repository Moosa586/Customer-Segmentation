#Customer Segmentation Project
This project leverages the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on shared characteristics. The aim is to understand customer segments and visualize them in a clear, user-friendly manner through a web-based interface. The application is built using Flask and Matplotlib to enable users to upload customer data, apply clustering, and visualize the results.

#Introduction
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their customers by dividing them into different groups based on similar traits. This can lead to more targeted marketing and improved customer satisfaction. This project allows users to upload a CSV file, run a K-Means clustering algorithm, and visualize the segmentation results with a colorful plot.

#Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Basic knowledge of Python, Flask, and machine learning concepts.
Git installed if you want to clone the repository.
1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd Customer-Segmentation-Project
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies separately from your system libraries.

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate


bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Application
Once the environment is set up, run the Flask application by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
5. Access the Application
After the application is running, open your browser and visit:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Usage
1. Upload a CSV file
Upload a CSV file containing customer data. Ensure that the data has numerical features that can be clustered. For example:

Feature1	Feature2	Age	Income
25	15	35	58000
30	22	42	64000
...	...	...	...
2. Choose Clustering Model
Select the K-Means model from the form. For simplicity, the number of clusters is set to 3, but this can be adjusted as needed in the code.

3. View the Results
Once you submit the form, the app will display the number of customer segments found and show a scatter plot with the cluster visualizations.

#Sample Input CSV Structure:
Make sure the CSV file has numerical columns that can be clustered. For example:

Feature1	Feature2	Gender	Age	Income
25	15	Male	35	58000
30	22	Female	42	64000
...	...	...	...	...
Note: Non-numeric columns like 'Gender' should be converted into numeric values (e.g., Male = 0, Female = 1) before clustering.

#Features
Upload CSV file for customer data.
Choose K-Means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation.
Visualize customer segments with a scatter plot.
User-friendly web interface with file upload functionality.
Technologies Used
Python: For core logic and data manipulation.
Flask: For building the web interface and handling user requests.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
Pandas: For reading and processing the CSV data.
Matplotlib: For plotting the customer segments.

#Troubleshooting
FileNotFoundError: Ensure the static folder exists in the project root, and that the plot is being saved correctly.
Matplotlib GUI Warning: If running into Matplotlib GUI warnings, they can usually be ignored, as the plots are being saved directly into the static folder and not shown on the screen.
